The few who survive these trials of ingenuity may become the first to create, and deftly wield, the first firearms.",

Through creative innovation and immaculate aim, you become a distant force of death on the battlefield.

This is the danger of new, untested technologies in a world where the arcane energies that rule the elements are ever present.",
